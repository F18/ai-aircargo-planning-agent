    "A planning graph consists of a sequence of \"layers\" alternating between `LiteralLayer` instances and `ActionLayer` instances. Each layer is a collection of literals or actions that _might_ be possible at that level of the planning graph. The implementation used in this project provides a `Set` interface for the collection in each layer, so the layers are iterable (the iterator yields the individual nodes) and support efficient set operations (union, intersection, inclusion, etc.).\n",

    "LiteralLayer_0 -> ActionLayer_0 -> LiteralLayer_1 -> ActionLayer_1 -> ... -> LiteralLayer_N\n",
